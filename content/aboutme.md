I am an interdisciplinary applied ecologist interested in improving the management and restoration of natural 
and working landscapes in the Western U.S. in the face of increasing threats from climate change, 
wildfire, and invasive species. My research draws on concepts from plant community ecology, conservation science, and 
rangeland ecology and management to understand how environmental changes and management practices including restoration 
affect ecosystem services and biodiversity across scales from population (genetics) to community to landscape level. 
I use a wide array of inferences from field surveys, field manipulative experiments, long-term observations, and modeling.

I am passionate about delivering actionable science that directly informs land management decisions on the ground. I value collaborative
research that includes local communities, underrepresented communities, and land managers with diverse backgrounds and perspectives.

I received my BS in Molecular Environmental Biology (2015) and my MS in Rangeland Management (2018) from 
University of California, Berkeley, and my PhD in Environmental Sciences, Studies, and Policy (2024) from University of Oregon. 
I moved to Colorado to work at the USDA-ARS as a Science Coordinator for the Long-Term Agroecosystem Research Network.
